# S3 Security and encryption

## Securing Buckets

  - By default all new buckets are private
  - You can setup access control to your buckets using:
    * Bucket Policies (permissions applied to the entire bucket)
    * Access Control Lists - apply to individual objects in a bucket
  - S3 Bucket Logging - Buckets can be configured to log all access requests;
  logging can be sent to another bucket.
