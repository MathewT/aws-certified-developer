# S3 101 (Just the important stuff.)

Files are between 1 byte and 5 terabytes.

Buckets must be unique globally, across regions and availability zones.

## Important Exam Notes

1. Read after Write consistency for PUTS of *new* objects.  New objects are
        immediately available for read after first PUT.  
2. Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETEs (Updates to objects via PUT
or DELETE can take some time to propagate.)
3. S3 is a simple key/value store.  
  * The *key* is the path/name of the object.
  * The *value* is the actual bytes of the data/file being stored.
  * Version ID is important for tracking value/data version.  
  * Metadata
  * Access Control Lists
4. Amazon guarantees 99.99 availability.
5. Tiered storage
6. Life cycle management
7. Versioning
8. Data encryption
9. Securing Data with ACLs and Bucket policies
10. Bucket URL format: https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name


## S3 Storage Tiers or Classes
  1. S3
    * 99.99% availability
    * 11 9s durability
  2. S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed)
    * Data objects that are accessed less frequently but requires rapid
      access when needed.   
    * Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee.
  3. Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)
    * 99.99% durability
    * 99.99% availability over a given year
    * Used to store data that can be lost or easily regenerated (e.g. image
      thumbnails)
  4. Glacier
    * Very cheap
    * Archival only
    * 3-5 hours to retrieve data


## S3 Charges
  1. Storage
  2. Requests
  3. Transfer


## Lifecyle Management Rules

1. S3 Standard to IA Transition:
  * 128Kb minimum size
  * 30 days after object creation

2. Transition to Glacier:
  * 1 day after object creation
  * 30 days after transition to IA (60 days after object creation)

3. Transition to Delete:
  * 1 day after object creation OR 1 day after transition to Glacier (61 days after
    object creation)

5. Can be used in conjunction with versioning.

6. Can be applied to current versions and previous versions of objects
