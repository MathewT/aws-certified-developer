## Important Exam Notes

    1. Read after Write consistency for PUTS of *new* objects.  New objects are
        immediately available for read after first PUT.  
    2. Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETEs (Updates to objects via PUT
        or DELETE can take some time to propagate.)
    3. S3 is a simple key/value store.  
      * The *key* is the path/name of the object.
      * The *value* is the actual bytes of the data/file being stored.
      * Version ID is important for tracking value/data version.  
      * Metadata
      * Access Control Lists
    4.  Amazon guarantees 99.99 availability.
