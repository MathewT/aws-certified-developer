# DynamoDb 101 (Just the important stuff)

1. NoSQL at infinite scale

2. Document and Key/Value data models

3. Fully managed

4. Ideal for mobile, web gaming, IoT

5. SSD data storage

6. Data spread across 3 different geographical data centers



## Data Consistency models
1. Eventually consistent READS. (Default)
  Data is consistent across all copies within one second of write.   Reads 1
  second after write will be consistent with current write

2. Strongly consistent READS.  
  Data is consistent across all copies immediately at the end of the write.  
  **NOTE** Strongly consistent reads is slower in performance than eventually
  consistent reads.  


## Basics

1. Tables
2. Items ("rows")
3. Attributes ("columns" or "fields")
4.
