# DynamoDb 101 (Just the important stuff)

1. NoSQL at infinite scale

2. Document and Key/Value data models

3. Fully managed

4. Ideal for mobile, web gaming, IoT

5. SSD data storage

6. Data spread across 3 different geographical data centers



## Data Consistency models
1. Eventually consistent READS. (Default)
    Data is consistent across all copies within one second of write.   Reads 1
  second after write will be consistent with current write

2. Strongly consistent READS.  
  Data is consistent across all copies immediately at the end of the write.  
  **NOTE** Strongly consistent reads is slower in performance than eventually
  consistent reads.  


## Basics

1. Tables
2. Items ("rows")
3. Attributes ("columns" or "fields")
  * Nested documents up to 35 levels deep

## Pricing
1. Provisioned throughput capacity
  1. Write throughput **$0.0065 per hour** for every 10 units **($0.0065/10)
  per hour cost**
  2. Read throughput **$0.0065 per hour** for every 50 units **($0.0065/50)
  per hour cost**
2. Storage
  1. First 25 GB stored per month is free
  2. $0.25 per GB per month after that
3. Example: *1 million reads and 1 million writes per day while storing 28 GB*
  1. Writes
    1. 1 million / 24 / 60 / 60 = **11.6** writes per second
    2. **1 Write Capacity Unit (WCU) = 1 write per second**
    3. Rounding up, **12** write capacity units (WCUs) are needed to satisfy
    this requirement.  **Always round up.**
    4. ($0.0065/10) per hour cost X 12 WCUs needed X 24 hours = **$0.1872 per day**
  2. Reads
    1. 1 million / 24 / 60 / 60 = **11.6** writes per second
    2. **1 Read Capacity Unit (RCU) = 1 read per second**
    3. Rounding up, **12** read capacity units (RCUs) are needed to satisfy 
    this requirement.  **Always round up.**
    4. ($0.0065/50) per hour cost X 12 WCUs needed X 24 hours = **$0.03744 per day**
  3. Storage
    1. 25 GB free
    2. 3 GB X $0.25 per GB per month
    3. = **$0.75** per month
