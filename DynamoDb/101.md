## Data Consistency models
1. Eventually consistent READS. (Default)
  Data is consistent across all copies within one second of write.   Reads 1
  second after write will be consistent with current write

2. Strongly consistent READS.  
  Data is consistent across all copies immediately at the end of the write.  
  **NOTE** Strongly consistent reads is slower in performance than eventually
  consistent reads.
