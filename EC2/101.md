# EC2 101

## EC2 Options

1. On Demand:  Fixed rate by the hour with no commitments.

    Usage scenarios:  

      Flexibility; no long term commitments;

      Short term applications; spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be
      interrupted

      Applications being developed or tested for the first time; dev/text
      environments

      Use on demand instances to supplement reserved instances during usage spikes




2. Reserved:  reserve capacity  1 or 3 year terms.

    Usage scenarios:

      Applications that are in steady state or predictable Usage

      Users are able to make up front payments for 1 or 3 years


3. Spot:  bid whatever price you want for instance capacity; if the market price
   goes above your bid, you are given an hour notice and Amazon terminates the
   instance.

    Usage scenarios:

      Applications that have flexible start and end times

      Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices

      Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

      Most commercially feasible

      Spot instances terminated by AWS, no charge for the hour

      Spot instances terminated by you, you are charged for the hour

    3. M3:  General purpose; Application servers

    4. C4:  Compute optimized; CPU intensive applications and databases

    5. C3:  Compute optimized; CPU intensive applications and databases

    6. R3:  Memory optimized; Memory intensive applications and databases

    7. G2:  GPU General purpose; video encoding, machine learning, 3D application
            streaming
    8. I2:  High speed storage; NoSQL databases, data warehousing

    9. D2:  Dense storage; Hadoop, File servers, data warehousing


## EBS Elastic Block storage

    S3 is object storage.  EBS is block storage for creating storage volumes that
    can be attached to EC2 instances.   Once attached to an EC2 instance, you can
    create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database or use them in
    any way you would use a block device.   

    EBS volumes are placed in specific availability zones where they are automatically
    replicated.

    Disk in the cloud.

    One EC2 can attach multiple EBS volumes.

    EBS Types

        1. GP2 - General Purpose SSD
            Designed for 99.999 availability
            Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB, up to 10,000 IOPS, burst to 3000 for short
            periods for volumes under 1GB
        2. IO1 - Provisioned IOPS
            For I/O intensive applications, large relational or NoSQL databases,
            For more than 10,000 IOPS
        3. Magnetic (Standard)
            Lowest cost per GB
