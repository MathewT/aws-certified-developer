# EC2 101

## EC2 Options

1. On Demand:  Fixed rate by the hour with no commitments.

    Usage scenarios:  

      Flexibility; no long term commitments;

      Short term applications; spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be
      interrupted

      Applications being developed or tested for the first time; dev/text
      environments

      Use on demand instances to supplement reserved instances during usage spikes




2. Reserved:  reserve capacity  1 or 3 year terms.

    Usage scenarios:

      Applications that are in steady state or predictable Usage

      Users are able to make up front payments for 1 or 3 years


3. Spot:  bid whatever price you want for instance capacity; if the market price
   goes above your bid, you are given an hour notice and Amazon terminates the
   instance.

    Usage scenarios:

      Applications that have flexible start and end times

      Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices

      Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

      Most commercially feasible

      Spot instances terminated by AWS, no charge for the hour

      Spot instances terminated by you, you are charged for the hour
