# Route53

## DNS Exam Tips
1. ELBs do not have static, pre-defined IPv4 addresses.  You resolve to the ELB server by DNS name, always
1. Alias Record is a Route53 specific record that allows the mapping of a naked domain name (zone apex record) 
to an ELB
1. Internet requests to a Route53 CNAME record will be charged by Amazon.  Requests to an Alias Record are not 
charged by Amazon
1. Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over CNAME:  There is no charge for Alias Record requests and 
it allows you to resolve a domain name to an ELB
1. Route53 is a global service, not region specific

## Routing Policies and Scenarios
1. Simple Routing Policy
  - Default routing policy when you create a new record set
  - Most commonly used when you have a single AWS resource that performs a function for 
  your domain.  Example:  1 web server that responds with content for http://example.com  
  - User DNS request -> Route53 -> ELB -> EC2 or other resource
1. Weighted Routing Policy
  - Allows splitting of traffic to different ELBs based on weights (percentages)
  - Example User DNS request -> Route53 -> 20% traffic to us-east-1, 80% of traffic to us-west-1
  - Example A/B web site testing, **likely an exam scenario**
  - Doesn't have to be different regions, can be different ELBs in the same region
1. Latency
1. Failover
1. Geolocation
