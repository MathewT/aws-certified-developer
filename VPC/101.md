# VPC Study and Exam Notes

A VPC is a logical data center in an AWS region.  VPCs span AZs but not regions.  

A VPC consists of:
  - an IGW or Virtual Private Gateway
  - Route tables
  - Network ACLs
  - Subnets
  - Security Groups

1. Two routes of entry into the VPC:  Internet gateway or Virtual Private Gateway
1. Internet gateway, for connecting to/from the Internet
1. Virtual Private Gateway, for VPN connection termination (e.g. to data center)



**Exam Tip**: 1 subnet = 1 availability zone (AZ).  Subnets cannot span across multiple AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Security Groups and NACLs can span multiple subnets and AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Only one Internet gateway per VPC

## Default VPC vs Custom VPC

1. Default VPCs are user friendly allowing you to immediately deploy instances
1. All subnets in a default VPC have a route out to the Internet.  They're all public.
1. Each EC2 instance deployed in the default VPC has a public and private IP address.
1. If you delete the default VPC, the only way to recover is to contact AWS.

## VPC Peering
1. Connect VPCs within a region via direct network route using private IP addresses, traffic doesn't go out over the Internet
1. Instances behave as though on the same private network
1. VPCs can be peered with other AWS accounts
1. Peering is in a star configuration: 1 central VPC peers with 4 others.  **NO TRANSITIVE PEERING!**  
1. You cannot talk to one VPC via another peered VPC


## Creating a Custom VPC

**Exam Tip**: IGW and Subnets not created by default.   Default security group, NACL and route table are created.

**Exam Tip**: In a VPC, the maximum addressable network size is /16; Always use /16 network (10.0.0.0/16) for VPC

**Exam Tip Pro Exam**:  The following IP addresses are reserved:
  - 10.0.0.0 : Network address
  - 10.0.0.1 : Reserved for VPC Router
  - 10.0.0.2 : Reserved by AWS for DNS server
  - 10.0.0.3 : Future use
  - 10.0.0.255 : Network broadcast address

1. When you create a VPC, the following are created by default:
    - route table
    - security group
    - network ACL
1. No Internet Gateway (IGW) is created by default
1. No Virtual Private Gateway is created by default
1. No Subnets automatically created by default
![Default VPC Objects](https://github.com/MathewT/aws-certified-developer/blob/master/VPC/vpc-default.PNG)
1. Leave the default route table alone. The default/main route table is private by default.  Keep it private as a best security practice.
1. In order to make a subnet public (talk to the Internet), first create an IGW and attach it to the VPC.
1. **Exam Tip:** Only one IGW per VPC is allowed.  
1. Before creating any EC2 instances, we must create a route out to the internet (e.g. so EC2 instances can apt-get updates)
  - Create a new route table
  - In the new route table, create a route out to the Internet (0.0.0.0/0 routes to destination IGW)
1. **Note:**  When you create a new subnet, it is associated to the main route table by default!  Subnets that need to access the Internet must be associated to the route table connected to the IGW.
1. In the new public route table, edit the assigned subnets and assign the "public" subnet to public 
route table
1. Modify the auto-assign public IP setting for the public subnet to Yes

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd24 php56 mysql55-server php56-mysqlnd
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
groupadd www
usermod -a -G www ec2-user
chown -R root:www /var/www
chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} +
find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} +
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
```

## NAT Instance Exam Tips

1. When creating a NAT EC2 instance, disable source/destination check on the instance
1. NAT EC2 instance must be in a public subnet
1. There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT EC2 instance
1. Must allocate a public IP address for the NAT EC2 instance
1. The amount of network traffic supported by the NAT instance directly depends on the instance size. If bottlenecking, increase the instance size
1. You can create high availability by using Auto Scaling groups, multiple subnets in different AZs and a script to failover
1. NAT EC2 instances are always behind a security group


## NAT Gateway Exam Tips
1. Preferred by enterprise
1. No security group association needed
1. Put in public subnet
1. Automatically assigned a public IP address
1. Update private route table to use the NAT gateway for Internet access by EC2 instances in private subnet
1. Scale automatically to 10Gbps
1. No need to patch, AWS handles updates and maintenance
1. No need to disable source/destination checks on NAT gateway
