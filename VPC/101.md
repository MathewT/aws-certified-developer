# VPC Study and Exam Notes

A VPC is a logical data center in an AWS region.  VPCs span AZs but not regions.  

**Exam Tip**: 1 subnet = 1 availability zone (AZ).  Subnets cannot span across AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Security Groups can span multiple subnets and AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Only one Internet gateway per VPC
