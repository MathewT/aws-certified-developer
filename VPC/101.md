# VPC Study and Exam Notes

:sparkle: VPC FAQ (https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/)

A VPC is a logical data center in an AWS region.  VPCs span AZs but not regions.  

A VPC consists of:
  - an IGW or Virtual Private Gateway
  - Route tables
  - Network ACLs
  - Subnets
  - Security Groups

**Exam Tip**: 1 subnet = 1 availability zone (AZ).  Subnets cannot span across AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Security Groups can span multiple subnets and AZs.  
**Exam Tip**: Only one Internet gateway per VPC

## Default VPC vs Custom VPC

1. Default VPCs are user friendly allowing you to immediately deploy instances
2. All subnets in a default VPC have a route out to the Internet.  They're all public.
3. Each EC2 instance deployed in the default VPC has a public and private IP address.
4. If you delete the default VPC, the only way to recover is to contact AWS.

## Creating a Custom VPC

**Exam Tip**: IGW and Subnets not created by default.   Default security group, NACL and route table are created.
