# Databases

## Automated Backups
  - Allow you to recover your database to any point in time (to the second) during the 
  "retention period"
  - Default retention period in RDS is 7 days
  - Retention persiod is 1 day to 35 days
  - Full daily snapshot and store transaction logs in S3 - free equal to the size of your database
  - Allows recovery to a specific point in time during the retention period
  - Backups are taken during a pre-defined window
  - Datbase I/O may be suspended during backups causing application latency!
  
## Snapshots
  - Manual
  - User initiated via console

## Restore
  - **Exam Tip** Whenever you restore from automated or snapshot backup, the restored database is a 
  new RDS instance with an new DNS endpoint
  - **Exam Tip** Restore a snapshot or automated backup to a larger instance to scale up the database 
  server
  
## Encryption
  - Encryption at rest supported for MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, SQL Server, Postgres
  - Uses AWS Key Management System (KMS) 
  - Encryption must be enabled at the time the database is created, not supported 
  after the database is already created
  - Everything gets encrypted:  data on disk, snapshots, automated backups
  - Create encrypted database and import data from unencrypted export (not backup or snapshot)
 
## Multi-AZ
  - RDS database in us-east-1 AZ does a **synchronous** copy to a different AZ (e.g. us-east-2)
  - If us-east-1 instance fails, AWS will auto failover to us-east-2, no need to change 
  the DNS endpoint.
  - **Exam tip:  **For disaster recovery (DR) only.  Not for performance or scaling
  - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB

## Read Replicas
  - Master database **asynchronously** writes to read only database replicas
  - For read heavy applications, EC2 instances are configured to point to read replicas
  - You can have read replicas of read replicas
  - Main database -> five read replicas
  - MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB
  - Not supported in Oracle or SQL Server
  - **Exam tip:  **Read replicas are for scaling, NOT for DR
  - Must have automated backups turned on for read replicas
  - Up to 5 read replica copies of one main database
  - Could be latency of data in a read replica
  - Each read replica will have its own DNS endpoint
  - Read replicas cannot be Multi-AZ
  - You can have read replicas of primary source Multi AZ databases
  - Read replicas can be promoted to primary source databases, breaks the read replica relationship
  - You can have read replicas in second regioin for MySQL and MariaDB only
  - Read replicas can be in a different AZ than the primary
 
## DynamoDB vs RDS
  - DynamoDB offers push-button scaling, no downtime for database scaling
  - RDS is more complicated, upgrade to a larger instance size or add read replicas (manual process)
  - RDS writes can only scale up via bigger hardware and only scale out (horizontal scale) for reads 
  (read replicas)
  - Choose DynamoDB for scaling without downtime

## RedShift
  - Petabyte scale data warehouse service in the cloud
  - Column oriented
  - Single node - 160 GB
  - Multi-node
    - Leader node:  manages client connections and receives queries
    - Compute node:  store data and perform computations and queries
    - Up to 128 compute nodes
  - Columnar data storage:  Row-based systems are ideal for transactions, column-based 
  systems are ideal for data warehouse and analytics
  - Queries involve aggregates over large sets of data
  - Columnar based data is stored sequentially on the storage media and require far fewer I/Os
  - Advanced compression:  columnar data is better compressed as it stores similar data sequentially on disk
  - Data is auto sampled as it is stored and the best compression is selected
  - Pricing:  
    - charged for compute node hours, total number of hours you run for all your compute nodes during the billing period
    - backup
    - data transfer within a VPC
  - Security:
    - Data encrypted in transit via SSL
    - Data encrypted at rest using AES-256, RedShift takes care of key management
    - Only available in 1 AZ
    
## Elasticache
  - In-memory data cache in the cloud
  - Memcached
    - Widely popular object caching
    - Elasticache is protocol compliant with memcached
  - Redis
    - In-memory key/value store
    - Supports data structures such as sorted sets and lists
    - Elasticache supports master/slave replication
    - Supports Multi AZ for cross AZ redundancy
  - **Exam Tip** Scenario question where a particular database is under a lot of load or stress, which service 
  should be used to alleviate?
    - Elasticache if the load is a read heavy load and not prone to frequent changes
    - RedShift if the load is caused by OLAP reports or transactions

## Aurora (RDS)
  - Bespoke AWS database
  - MySQL compatible
  - 5 times the performance of MySQL at 1 tenth the cost of Oracle
  - Scaling:
    - Autoscales
    - Scales in 10GB increments to 64TB
    - Compute can scale to 32 vCPUs and 224GB RAM
    - Push button scaling, does require some downtime but fast
  - Durability:  2 copies of your data in each AZ, minimum 3 AZs, 6 total copies of data
  - Self healing
  - Replicas:
    - Aurora Replicas (up to 15)
    - MySQL read replicas (up to 5)
    - Key difference:  Aurora Replica supports automatic failover if the primary database is lost
