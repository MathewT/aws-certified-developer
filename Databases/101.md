# Databases

## Automated Backups
  - Allow you to recover your database to any point in time (to the second) during the 
  "retention period"
  - Default retention period in RDS is 7 days
  - Retention persiod is 1 day to 35 days
  - Full daily snapshot and store transaction logs in S3 - free equal to the size of your database
  - Allows recovery to a specific point in time during the retention period
  - Backups are taken during a pre-defined window
  - Datbase I/O may be suspended during backups causing application latency!
  
## Snapshots
  - Manual
  - User initiated via console

## Restore
  - Whenever you restore from automated or snapshot backup, the restored database is a 
  new RDS instance with an new DNS endpoint
  - Restore a snapshot or automated backup to a larger instance to scale up the database 
  server
  
## Encryption
  - Encryption at rest supported for MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, SQL Server, Postgres
  - Uses AWS Key Management System (KMS) 
  - Encryption must be enabled at the time the database is created, not supported 
  after the database is already created
  - Everything gets encrypted:  data on disk, snapshots, automated backups
  - Create encrypted database and import data from unencrypted export (not backup or snapshot)
 
## Multi-AZ
  - RDS database in us-east-1 AZ does a synchronous copy to a different AZ (e.g. us-east-2)
  - If us-east-1 instance fails, AWS will auto failover to us-east-2, no need to change 
  the DNS endpoint.
  - For disaster recovery (DR) only.  Not for performance or scaling!
  - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB
