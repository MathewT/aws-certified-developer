  "retention period"
  - Default retention period in RDS is 7 days
  - Retention persiod is 1 day to 35 days
  - Full daily snapshot and store transaction logs in S3 - free equal to the size of your database
  - Allows recovery to a specific point in time during the retention period
  - Backups are taken during a pre-defined window
  - Datbase I/O may be suspended during backups causing application latency!
